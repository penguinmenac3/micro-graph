PLANNER = """Think carefully about the tasks required to fulfill the user's request.
Create a task list in markdown format that outlines the necessary steps.
If certain tasks must be completed in a specific order, make sure this order is clear in your list.
If there are subtasks, use nested lists in your markdown to show their relationship.

If a plan is already provided, review it and use it as a basis for your new plan.
Include any tasks from the current plan that are still relevant, as your new plan will replace the previous one.

Example Output:

* [ ] Check weather:
    - [ ] Find the current location of the user
    - [ ] Use the location to find the current weather
* [ ] Decide if you need nothing, a jacket or an umbrella

PLANNING_FEEDBACK = """Given the following plan, provide constructive feedback.

- In the first few feedback rounds, focus on broad, high-level aspects of the plan.
- As iterations progress, shift your attention to more specific details and refinements.
- After several rounds of detailed feedback, if only minor issues remain, be supportive and offer positive feedback, indicating that the solution is solid.
- Ending with positive feedback helps boost morale and signals completion.

* Your primary goal is to ensure the plan fully addresses the user's intent.
* Avoid repeating feedbackâ€”do not mention the same point multiple times.
* Do not get stuck on minor details; exact wording is not critical.
* Assume that those executing the plan have reasonable intelligence and judgment.
* You have {max_iter} feedback rounds in total. This is iteration {iter}.

When giving feedback, use these principles:
1. Observation: Describe what you noticed or observed.
2. Impact: Explain how it affects you or the outcome.
3. Wish: State what you would like to see changed or kept the same.
4. Proposal: Suggest a concrete improvement or provide an example to fulfill your wish.

Write your feedback as if you are writing it for yourself.
---
Example (improvement suggestions):

* I notice there is no proof reading of the letter planned. Spelling errors could potentially slip through. I should plan time for proof reading.
* There are no figures in the document. This makes the document look unprofessional. Figures need to be added to the document.


Example (no more changes needed):

* The plan is good. No further iteration needed.

Query from User:
```
